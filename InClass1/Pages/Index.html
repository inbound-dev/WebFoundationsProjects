        Edgar Allan Poe, son of Actress Eliza Poe and Actor David Poe Jr., born
        19th of January 1809, <br />
        was mostly known for his poems and short tales and his literary
        criticism. He has been given credit for <br />
        inventing the detective story and his psychological thrillers have been
        influences for many writers worldwide. <br />
        <br />
        In 1827 Edgar published his first book, "Tamerlane and other poems"
        anonymously under the signature "A <br />
        Bostonian". The poems were heavily influenced from
        <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lord-Byron-poet">Byron</a>
        and showed of a youthful attitude.

        This maiden she lived with no other thought, <br />
        Than to love and be loved by me. <br />
        <br />
        I would define, in brief, the Poetry of words as the Rhythmical Creation
        of Beauty. <br />
        Its sole arbiter is Taste. <br />
        <br />
        Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,
        <br />
        Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dreamed before. <br />
        <br />
        The skies they were ashen and sober; <br />
        The leaves they were crisped and sere — The leaves they were withering
        and sere;<br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was night in the lonesome October, <br />
        Of my most immemorial year.

        Poe suffered from bouts of depression and madness, and he attempted
        suicide in 1848. In September the following year he disappeared for
        three days after a drink at a birthday party and on his way to visit his
        new fiancée in Richmond. He turned up in a delirious condition in a
        <a href="http://www.baltimorecity.gov/">Baltimore</a> gutter and died on
        October 7, 1849.
